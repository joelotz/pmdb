What is PMDB?
----------------
 
PMDB is my first attempt at creating a full featured web application. It
started as a convenient way to implement and test my PHP/SQL learnings
at the time - but evolved into an actual useful application. 

The client is a manufacturing company that needed the ability to track the
preventive maintenance jobs on the equipment. There were multiple users, 
multiple levels of users (admin, superuser, user), and multiple categories
of users (electrical, mechanical, etc.).
 
Requirements
------------
 
Since this project is still in development, the only systems tested are 
the following:

Development Platform
 * Ubuntu 9.10 - the Karmic Koala
 * Apache 2.2.12
 * PHP 5.2.10
 * MySQL 5.1.37
 * Firefox 3.5.8
 
Documentation
-------------
 
PMDB is still in the early stages of development.  There is currently no
documentation.
